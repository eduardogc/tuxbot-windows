## Installation

First of all, you need [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) installed with the environment variables configured to your machine.
You also have to install [pywin32](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/) libraries in order to have a correct functionality of the bot.
If your Windows version is not English-US, you'll also need to change your text-to-speech to be English-US (Microsoft Zira). 

Put TuxBot anywhere you want and run installation-windows.bat in cmd as administrator.

run the bot with **python chatbot.py**

## TODO and future work

This version is the most stable version for Windows at the moment, but it is still on development, and you certain find
a lot of bugs on it. Future versions with more stable code and more functionality will be available soon, but be free to
download and use it for your own purpose. Also, suggestions of features/bug fixes are welcome =]
